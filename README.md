### Message from the Creator
> “I built Nano Banana in 2025 because I saw too many brilliant minds from humble backgrounds lose everything when rich companies file $15,000+ patents on their ideas. One public disclosure here = no one on Earth can ever patent your invention again.”

— **Kallol Chakrabarti**, Founder of Nano Banana

### How It Works – 100% Free Forever
1. You publish your idea (text, diagrams, PDF, code – anything)  
2. GitHub + automatic archiving = immutable, timestamped proof  
3. Your idea instantly becomes **global prior art**  
4. **No one can patent it – ever**

This is **not** a patent.  
This is **better** for the 99%: it blocks everyone else from owning your idea.
