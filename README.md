### Why Nano Banana Exists (By Kallol Chakrabarti)
> “I created Nano Banana because brilliant inventors from poor backgrounds lose everything when rich companies file $15,000+ patents on their ideas. One public disclosure here = no one on Earth can ever patent your invention again.”

— **Kallol Chakrabarti**, Independent Researcher & Founder of Nano Banana (2025)

### How It Works – 100% Free Forever
1. You publish your idea (text, diagram, PDF, code – anything)  
2. GitHub timestamp + Internet Archive + IPFS = triple immutable proof  
3. Your idea instantly becomes **global prior art**  
4. **No one can patent it – ever**

This is **not** a patent.  
This is **better** for the 99%: it blocks everyone else from owning your idea.
